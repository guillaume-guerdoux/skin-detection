# skin-detection
This project aims at create an algorithm for detecting skin on picture

## Installation
Install OpenCV (I used opencv 3.1.0).
Use Python 3.5.2

## First : Explicit method to recognize skin
First, I used methods used in [Peer et al. 2003] to describe skin explicitly. 
This method is defined in assets/gc2003vsa.pdf
